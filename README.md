# Children Without a Horizon

This project explores the intersection of childhood, education, health, and socioeconomic disparity in Brazil—juxtaposed against global data. Through minimalist storytelling, data dashboards, and reflective essays, we aim to reveal unseen realities and inspire systemic change.

## Features

- Interactive dashboards comparing Brazil to OECD countries
- Long-form reflections on policy and potential
- Curated datasets and visual storytelling
- Published via GitHub Pages
