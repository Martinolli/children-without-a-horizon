        📝 <strong>The Fog of Potential</strong><br>
        In Brazil, childhood is often a negotiation with scarcity. Education is not a promise—it’s a gamble. Health is not a right—it’s a lottery. And the future? It’s a fog that only a few can see through.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I look at the numbers, I don’t just see statistics—I see stolen potential. According to recent data, only 43.6% of second graders can read proficiently, compared to nearly 80% in OECD countries. Behind each data point is a classroom without enough books, teachers stretched thin, and a child quietly slipping through the cracks of forgotten policy. Education, in theory, is the great equalizer. In Brazil, it often magnifies inequality instead.

        Take nourishment: only 1 in 5 children aged 2 to 9 receive adequate daily meals. In wealthier nations, food security is often a baseline assumption. But here, lunch might be the only meal, and breakfast might be a silent longing. Malnutrition doesn’t just stunt bodies—it stunts possibility. It slows minds, dulls imagination, and casts long shadows over potential futures.
      </p>

        Health care, too, is a coin toss. Polio vaccination rates hover at 77.2%, trailing behind the 95% benchmark that most OECD nations maintain. It’s not a lack of desire—it’s a lack of access. In remote areas, parents walk miles for clinics that have no doctors. Maternal mortality remains heartbreakingly high: 117.4 deaths per 100,000 live births, nearly tenfold the rate of countries with stronger infrastructure. Every mother lost is a future unbuilt. Every child growing without a parent carries trauma that ripples through generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        And perhaps most telling: nearly half of all Brazilian children (0–14) live in poverty. That number doesn’t just quantify financial hardship—it maps a national ethos. In other countries, children are raised with the expectation of thriving. Here, many are raised with the hope of surviving.

        We need dashboards not just to display numbers—but to bear witness. This data should provoke discomfort. It should demand action. Because where others see gaps in spreadsheets, I see absences in dreams. The fog that clouds the future of Brazilian children is not inevitable—it’s constructed, layer by layer, through neglect, bureaucracy, and silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        And it is our job to clear it.
